            <h4>Key Lime Pi setup:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Place the Key Lime Pi loaded SDHC card into the Raspberry Pi.</li>
                <li>Plug in a keyboard and mouse into the USB ports.</li>
                <li>Attach the HDMI cable to your Raspberry Pi and your monitor.</li>
                <li>Insert the micro USB power adapter into the Raspberry Pi and plug the adapter into an electrical outlet to power on the device.</li>
                <li>Wait until you are prompted for the Username and Password. (This information have been included on the printed version of these instructions)</li>
                <li>After successfully instering the provided username and password. Type "startx" and press the enter key to access the graphical user interface.</li>
                <li>Continue to the Electrum Setup portion of the instructions.</li>
              </ol>
  					<h4>Electrum setup:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Double click the LXTerminal icon on the desktop - This will launch a terminal window</li>
                <li> In the terminal, type “electrum -o” (-o designates Offline Mode) and press the enter key - This will open Electrum for the first time.</li>
                <li>Select “Create New Wallet”.</li>
                <li>Electrum provides you with a 12-word seed.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>This seed can be used to recover your wallet if anything happens to your SD card, or if you forget your passwords.</li>
                  </ul>  
                <li>Use a text editor such as Leafpad to copy and paste the seed into.</li> 
                <li>Save the seed in the home directory, for example, as “keylime.seed”.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Alternative: Write down the seed and keep it in a <b>extremely</b> safe place.</li>
                    <li>If somebody gets your seed, then they will have access to all of the coins in this wallet.</li>
                  </ul> 
                <li>Electrum will ask you to confirm that you have saved the seed somewhere, so make sure it is in the text editor and paste it or retype it into the confirmation window and proceed.</li>
                <li>Set a wallet password that you will remember to encrypt your wallet. - This password will be used when signing transactions with your offline wallet.</li>
                <li>In Electrum, go to Wallet → Master Public Key. Copy the Master Public Key to a text editor such as Leafpad and save it in the home directory, for example, as “Master-Public-Key.txt”</li>
                <li>Quit Electrum.</li>
              </ol>
            <h4>Encrypt Seed:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Open up a Terminal window by clicking the LXTerminal icon on the Desktop.</li>
                <li>Encrypt your seed by typing into the Terminal window: “gpg --symmetric keylime.seed” and press the enter key.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><i>Use a strong password that you will remember.</i></li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Delete the original seed file by typing into the Termial window: “shred -u keylime.seed” and press the enter key.</li>
                <li>Plug a USB drive into the Key Lime Pi and copy the two files you just created to it: “keylime.seed.gpg” and “Master-Public-Key.txt”.</li>
              </ol>
            <h4>Online Computer:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Plug the USB Stick into your internet-connected computer and copy the encrypted “keylime.seed.gpg” file to your filesystem for backup and distribution purposes.</li>
                <li>Install Electrum onto your internet-connected computer.</li>
                <li>At first launch, select “Restore Wallet from Master Public Key”.</li>
                <li>When prompted, provide the key located in “Master-Public-Key.txt” into Electrum.</li>
                <li>This creates a “Watch Only” wallet that has only public keys of your wallet while keeping your private keys offline forever. You can use this Watch Only wallet to monitor your balances and initiate new transactions.</li>
              </ol>
